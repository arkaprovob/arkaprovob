👋 Hi, I’m Arko, your friendly neighborhood SSE from Red Hat. So, I've been around the tech scene for over 11 years, and guess what? I spent a good chunk of my early days grinding away at multiple startups. Those startup days were a total rollercoaster🎢! But hey, they shaped me up,  and fueled my passion for crafting high-performance solutions. Trust me, nothing teaches you more than the startup hustle. Fast forward to today, with that edge, I love architecting  backend stuff. And oh, I'm pretty deep into Kubernetes, OpenShift, and messing around with Kubernetes Operators. Dive into cloud-native with me, why don't ya? 😎

- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Development, Microservices, Cloud-Native Architectures, 🤖 LLM, SLM, and GenAI 🤖.

- 🌱 While I have sound expertise in Backend Development, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Kubernetes Operators, I'm currently diving deep into Generative AI, unveiling its vast possibilities.

- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on software development projects, innovative solutions, and backend strategies. Let's push technology boundaries together.

💀Hooked on generative AI lately and it's turned me into a night owl! Who needs sleep when there's a whole world of AI research papers and Git repos to explore, right? I'm chugging through this tech buffet like there's no tomorrow, always worried I'll miss out on the coolest bits. It's like my brain's on a non-stop AI party, and sleep wasn't invited.
